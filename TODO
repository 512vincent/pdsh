- Improve deja-gnu support
  o resolve problems with dejagnu-1.4.2-3:
    ERROR: Couldn't find config.guess program.
- Addy requests more prun-like options
- Optional pdsh.conf file for configurable system wide defaults
- Improve xpoll() interface??
- autoconf putenv
- support long options
- command line check for fanout > posix thread limit
- option to allocate all threads/mem before executing command
  - important so that if fanout is too large, commands won't
    be started and killed halfway through.
- bproc rcmd module
- netgroups module
- reverse pdcp support
  - resulting filenames add ".hostname"
  - last entry must be directory on local machine
- option to remove "hostname:" in front of output
- keyword that allows hostname to put replaced in the command line
  - i.e. pdsh -w node1,node2 cat /nfsdir/file.%n
         would put file.node1 and file.node2 into the nfsdir.
