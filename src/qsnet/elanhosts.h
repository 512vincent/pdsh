 *  Config file format is as follows:
 *
 *    Type  ElanIDs  Hostnames
 *
 *  The "Type" field may be "eip" for an eip interface, "eth" for an
 *    ethernet interface, or "other" for anything else. ("eth" and
 *    "other" are equivalent at this time)
 *
 *  The "ElanIDs" field consists of a list of one or more ElanIDs in
 *    the form "[i-j,n-m,..]" or just "N" for a single ElanID.
 *
 *  The "Hostnames" field consists of the hostnames which correspond
 *    to the ElanIDs. If the hostnames have a numeric suffix a bracketed
 *    hostlist is allowed (see hostlist.[ch]) 
 *
 *  For Example:
 *
 *    Type  ElanIDs  Hostnames
 *    eip   [0-10]   host[0-10]
 *    eth   [0-10]   ehost[0-10]
 *    eth   [0,1]    host0-eth1,host1-eth1
 *
 *  Returns 0 on succes, -1 for failure.
