	* opt.c: Abort when -x option given but hostlist_delete() returns 0
	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: only need READLINE_LIBS for pdsh binary

2002-09-27 garlick
	* Added support for readline in interactive mode if found.
	* Taggged pdsh-1-7-4chaos

2002-09-27 grondo

	* pdsh.1.in, pdcp.1.in: Improve documentation of hostname 
	  range handling (gnat pdsh/97)

2002-09-26 grondo
	* configure.ac: workaround autoconf-2.53 bug affecting improper
	  expansion of path in AC_PATH_PROG macro (fix for pdsh/116)

2002-09-26 garlick
	* Mark fixed pdsh/118 (bad usage of hostlist api)
	* Removed possibilty of string overflow in a couple places.
	* Taggged pdsh-1-7-3chaos (sent to LNXI for MCR)

2002-09-12 garlick
	* Reordered ChangeLog in reverse chronological order.
	* Mark fixed Elan context number wrap-around bug.

2002-09-12 garlick

	* Automake-ified
	* Have `dshbak -c' generate bracketed ranges compatible with pdsh -w
	* Updated testsuite for compatibility with bracketed host ranges

2002-08-12 garlick
	* Make all static "helper" functions underbar-prefixed.

2002-08-11 garlick
	* If no genders, mpich machines, or SDR, allow configuration, but 
	  pdsh -a generates an error.
	* Fix SDR wcoll generation to use hostlist package.
	* Fixed --enable-debug option in configure.ac.
	* Removed range operator configurability altogether.
	* Enable "reckless hostrange expansion" (foo1-4 style ranges) for AIX


2002-08-10 garlick
	* Broke TODO out of ChangeLog
	* Removed aborted attempt at QsNet cleanup (libqsw dir)
	* Added support for Mark's hostlist.[ch].
	* Added COPYING and added GPL headers to source modules.
	* Removed code that deleted unreachable hosts from the target list in
	  interactive mode.  This didn't work because we fork for each
	  round.  Got rid of -c option which was used to disable this behavior.
	  As this has not worked for a long time, probably won't be missed.
	* Handle arbitrarily large cap->Bitmap in qcmd/qshd protocol.
	* Taggged pdsh-1-7-1chaos

2002-08-10 addy@quadrics.com (via garlick)
	* Removed garlick's conditional support for new driver
	  (addy's changes below are more complete)
	* ELAN_CAPABILITY has had the Generation element name changed. 
	  This change should be backwards compatible to older headers.
	* libelan now requires ELAN_CAP_TYPE_BROADCASTABLE to be always set 
	  as it supports segmented broadcast.
	* The elan3_create() code needed work to sync up with the new ioctl 
	  based device interface.
	* The xinet.d/qshell script was trying to use a service call 'xshell'.
	  Changed to qshell to match the /etc/service entry.
	* Doing a 'service xinetd restart' seems to cause the daemon to die
	  shortly after starting when done with pdsh or prun. I changed it to
	  'reload' inside the specfile which seems safer.

2002-07-22 grondona (via garlick)
	* Support HAVE_WORKING_STRERROR_R || STRERROR_R_CHAR_P
	  mail.gnu.org/pipermail/autoconf-patches/2001-October/007964.html

2002-06-20 akeane@quadrics.com (via garlick)
	* configure.ac fix to find pthreads on OSF/TRU64.
	* Taggged pdsh-1-6-4chaos.

2002-06-14 garlick
	* Moved list_split_range to hostrange.c (now called range_split)

2002-06-03 garlick
	* Fixed a bug in dshbak which did not properly compress multi-digit
	  hostname suffixes.
	* Switch ChangeLog format.
	* Added a few test cases to deja-gnu.

2002-05-29 garlick
	* Pdsh would sometimes block when cleaning up after a Ctrl-C.
	  Change fcntl(efd, F_SETFD, O_NONBLOCK) to F_SETFL (xrcmd.c)
	  Add fcntl call to k4cmd.c and qcmd.c.
	* Added include <qsw/types.h> to compile with RMS 2.73.
	  Other API changes for new quadrics libs.
	* Temporarily disable --with-rms and PAM support in qshd
	* Taggged pdsh-1-6-3chaos.

2002-05-24 garlick
	* Allow hostname ranges in WCOLL files.
	* Add -x option to exclude a list of hostnames from WCOLL.
	* Genders: -i option now selects canonical names.  The default is to
	  get what nodeattr -r gives you (alternate names, if any).
	* Tagged pdsh-1-6-2 
	* Released 1.6-2 to http://www.llnl.gov/icc/lc/pdsh.html
	* Chaos flag in spec file back on, tagged pdsh-1-6-2chaos

2002-04-11 garlick
	* RMS: Get rid of -P and -N options and use RMS_RESOURCEID as set by
	  the RMS 'allocate' command instead.
	* Change semantics of -n option: now it is tasks per node instead of 
	  total number of tasks.  This is no longer a qshell specific argument,
  	  but unless qshell is used it must be == 1.

2002-02-09 garlick
	* Misc cleanup of headers, function defs, README, and man pages.
	  Run man pages through autoconf.
	* Test HAVE_WORKING_STRERROR_R before using strerror_r (pdsh-1.6 %m 
	  fails on AIX).
	* Added HAVE_MTSAFE_GETHOSTBYNAME and HAVE_MAGIC_RSHELL_CLEANUP in
	  place of #ifdef _AIX.
	* Use socklen_t for accept() length argument and add a check in
	  autoconf to default it to int if undefined.
	* Rcp code now handles short writes on socket.  A short write would
	  have corrupted the copied file, though this has never been reported.
	* Additional configure options: --with-fanout=N, --with-timeout=N, 
	  --with-rangeop=c.  Removed -x and -X options since this is now
	  configurable at compile time.
	* Print "timed out" message instead of "interrupted system call" if
	  xrcmd/qcmd times out waiting for a response from the server 
	  (gnats:45).

2001-12-24 garlick, grondona
	* Call htons on hard-coded port numbers before using (rcmd.c, k4cmd.c)
	* Renamed rcmd.c -> xrcmd.c, pipecmd.c -> sshcmd.c.
	* Add -Wall to CFLAGS and eliminate all warnings on Linux.
	* Updated to latest Chris Dunlap RPM Make target for Linux.
	* Support signal propagation via rsh backchannel (dsh.c, xrcmd.c).
	* Added hidden magic cookie and size integers to xmalloc buffers.
	  Changed names to avoid conflict with dmalloc (now Strdup, Malloc, 
	  Free, Realloc).  Delete size pointer from various functions that
	  deal with resizeable strings.
	* Use memset instead of bzero.
	* Added qshell support for running Quadrics Elan3 jobs on Linux
	  with -E option and qshd server (added qshd subpackage to RPM target).
	* Stderr socket now opened by default to enable proper remote cleanup
	  after SIGINT, except on AIX where cleanup seems to work without the
	  extra socket.  Everywhere but AIX, the meaning of the -s option is now
	  reversed.
	* Default fanout is 64 on systems where we don't open stderr by default,
	  e.g. AIX, and 32 everywhere else.
	* Added support for expansion of hostname ranges passed through -w
	  (e.g. -w host1-5 means run on host1,host2,...,host5) (Mark Grondona)
	* Added new options -x and -X for disabling hostname range expansion
	  and defining new expansion operator, respectively. (Mark Grondona)
	* Added support for allocating the wcoll from an RMS partition.
	* Autoconfiscated. 
	* Added a list of configured features to pdsh -V output.
	* Avoid non-portable gethostbyname_r call on non-AIX system by doing 
	  all DNS lookups before threads start up.
	* Configure --with-ssh configures pdsh to use ssh for all connections.
	  Configure --with-krb4 configures pdsh to use krb4 for all 
	  connnections.  The two configuration options cannot be specified 
	  together.  In the absense of either, rsh is used (the preferred 
	  option).  Got rid of -e, -R, and -k options for selecting these at 
	  runtime.  Do not use rsh for non-root users if --with-krb4 specified.
	* Support ssh2's different option for batch mode.
	* If --with-machines=/path/to/machines is specified, use that for -a
	  processing no matter what.  In the absense of a machines file, if
	  SDRGetObjects exists, use that; if nodeattr exists, use that.
	  None of the above is a configure error.
	* Released 1.6 to http://www.llnl.gov/icc/lc/pdsh.html
	* Chaos flag in spec file back on, tagged pdsh-1-6-1chaos

2001-06-28 garlick
	* Renamed spec file to pdsh.spec.  Gzip installed man pages on Linux.
	* Moved path definitions to conf.h.  Changed nodeattr path to /usr/bin.
	* Fixed handling of numerical ranges with multiple root names (dshbak)
	* Fix %S handling to avoid truncating dotted quads (err.c)
	* Rename pcp to pdcp - avoid conflict with SGI Performance Co-Pilot RPM.
	* Updated RPM rules for chaos release.
	* Released version 1.5 (linux only)

2001-04-25 garlick
	* Added RPM spec file.
	* Fixed bug with opt_list dumping core on linux.
	* Added pdsh -V to display version (PDSH_VERSION in conf.h).
	* Changed wcoll logic on SP so pdsh -aiv drops nodes which have
	  either switch_responds or host_responds false instead of falling
	  back to the reliable_hostname.
	* Added wcoll hack to deal with changed SDR attributes for Colony switch
	* Released version 1.4

2000-07-14 garlick
	* Activated POSIX mode for getopt() on linux.
	* Abort cleanly if working collective is empty.
	* Fixed bug in pcp option handling (core on empty source file list).
	* Added install rule for pcp link to Makefiles.
	* Added -d (debug) option to get verbose thread status on ^C,
	  and connect/command time report at the end.
	* Use gethostbyname_r() on linux, but need mutex anyway for RH6.2.
	* Cleanup of rcmd selection code
	* -c option taken out of usage message due to lack of interest,
	  though still supported for SP dsh compatibility.  Took SP-isms
	  i.e. "partitions" and "working collective" out of Usage message
	  and other places.
	* Removed Makefile.sol and Makefile.aix42 (added commented out LIBS
	  defs to Makefile for solaris and aix42)
	* Fix DSHPATH handling for csh users.
	* Reword man entry for -l to note that even root needs to be in .rhosts
	  file of remote user.
	* Rework README.
	* Added dshbak perl script and manpage.
	* Added -S option to make pdsh return largest of remote return codes,
	  or 254 if any of the rsh transactions fail.
	* Added pcp man page.
	* Added -e option and pipecmd.c to use ssh.
	* Convert bcopy, index, rindex -> memcpy, strchr, strrchr.
	* Verified working on the following platforms:
	  Linux 2.2.14-5.0 i686, Linux 2.2.14 #5 SMP alpha, 
	  Linux 2.2.14-5.0smp sparc, AIX 3 4, OSF1 V4.0 alpha,
	  SunOS 5.7 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise
	* Released version 1.3

2000-06-22 garlick
	* -b option to cause single SIGINT to terminate pdsh (needed when pdsh
	  is run from a script).
	* 1:1 feature in release 1.1 was actually #ifdefed out.
	* Call sigaction() instead of signal() to avoid old-style signal
	  semantics.  (Was avoiding on AIX by linking with -lbsd).  Also, block
	  SIGINT in all but main thread to be compatible with Linux pthreads,
	  which seems to deliver that signal to all threads that don't block it.
	* Pcp functionality added.
	* Fixed DSHPATH.
	* Added genders support.
	* Released version 1.2.

1999-04-13 garlick
	* Portability to linux, OSF1, AIX4.3.2, Solaris 2.5.
	* Request 1:1 mapping to kernel threads, if M:N available.
	* Kerberos IV off by default.
	* Released version 1.1

1998-09-04 garlick
	* Initial release of version 1.0
