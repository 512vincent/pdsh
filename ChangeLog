Release 1.0	4 Sept 1998 <garlick@llnl.gov>

	Initial release.

Release 1.1 	13 Apr 1999 <garlick@llnl.gov>

	Portability to linux, OSF1, AIX4.3.2, Solaris 2.5.

	Request 1:1 mapping to kernel threads, if M:N available.

	Kerberos IV off by default.

Release 1.2	22 June 2000 <garlick@llnl.gov>

	-b option to cause single SIGINT to terminate pdsh (needed when pdsh
	is run from a script).

	1:1 feature in release 1.1 was actually #ifdefed out.

	Call sigaction() instead of signal() to avoid old-style signal
	semantics.  (Was avoiding on AIX by linking with -lbsd).  Also, block
	SIGINT in all but main thread to be compatible with Linux pthreads,
	which seems to deliver that signal to all threads that don't block it.

	pcp functionality added

	fixed DSHPATH
	
	added genders support

Release 1.3

	Activated POSIX mode for getopt() on linux.

	Abort cleanly if working collective is empty.

	Fixed bug in pcp option handling (core on empty source file list).

	Added install rule for pcp link to Makefiles.

	Added -d (debug) option to get verbose thread status on ^C,
	and connect/command time report at the end.

	Use gethostbyname_r() on linux, but need mutex anyway for RH6.2.

	Cleanup of rcmd selection code

	-c option taken out of usage message due to lack of interest,
	though still supported for SP dsh compatibility.  Took SP-isms
	i.e. "partitions" and "working collective" out of Usage message
	and other places.

	Removed Makefile.sol and Makefile.aix42 (added commented out LIBS
	defs to Makefile for solaris and aix42)

	Fix DSHPATH handling for csh users.

	Reword man entry for -l to note that even root needs to be in .rhosts
	file of remote user.

	Rework README.
	
	Added dshbak perl script and manpage.

	Added -S option to make pdsh return largest of remote return codes,
	or 254 if any of the rsh transactions fail.

	Added pcp man page.

	Added -e option and pipecmd.c to use ssh.

	Convert bcopy, index, rindex -> memcpy, strchr, strrchr.

	Verified working on the following platforms:
	- Linux 2.2.14-5.0 i686
	- Linux 2.2.14 #5 SMP alpha
	- Linux 2.2.14-5.0smp sparc
	- AIX 3 4
	- SunOS 5.7 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise
	- OSF1 V4.0 alpha

Release 1.4

	Added RPM spec file.

	Fixed bug with opt_list dumping core on linux.
	
	Added pdsh -V to display version (PDSH_VERSION in conf.h).

	Changed wcoll logic on SP so pdsh -aiv drops nodes which have
	either switch_responds or host_responds false instead of falling
	back to the reliable_hostname.

	Added wcoll hack to deal with changed SDR attributes for Colony switch

Release 1.5

	Renamed spec file to pdsh.spec.  Gzip installed man pages on Linux.

	Moved path definitions to conf.h.  Changed nodeattr path to /usr/bin.

	Fixed handling of numerical ranges with multiple root names (dshbak)

	Fix %S handling to avoid truncating dotted quads (err.c)

	Rename pcp to pdcp - avoid conflict with SGI Performance Co-Pilot RPM.

	Updated RPM rules for chaos release.

	(This release was never used on the IBM SP as far as I know)

Release 1.6

	Call htons on hard-coded port numbers before using (rcmd.c, k4cmd.c)

	Renamed rcmd.c -> xrcmd.c, pipecmd.c -> sshcmd.c.

	Add -Wall to CFLAGS and eliminate all warnings on Linux.

	Updated to latest Chris Dunlap RPM Make target for Linux.

	Support signal propagation via rsh backchannel (dsh.c, xrcmd.c).

	Added hidden magic cookie and size integers to xmalloc buffers.
	Changed names to avoid conflict with dmalloc (now Strdup, Malloc, 
	Free, Realloc).  Delete size pointer from various functions that
	deal with resizeable strings.

	Use memset instead of bzero.

	Added qshell support for running Quadrics Elan3 jobs on Linux
	with -E option and qshd server (added qshd subpackage to RPM target).

	Stderr socket now opened by default to enable proper remote cleanup
	after SIGINT, except on AIX where cleanup seems to work without the
	extra socket.  Everywhere but AIX, the meaning of the -s option is now
	reversed.

	Default fanout is 64 on systems where we don't open stderr by default,
	e.g. AIX, and 32 everywhere else.

	Added support for expansion of hostname ranges passed through -w
	(e.g. -w host1-5 means run on host1,host2,...,host5) (Mark Grondona)

	Added new options -x and -X for disabling hostname range expansion
	and defining new expansion operator, respectively. (Mark Grondona)

	Added support for allocating the wcoll from an RMS partition.

	Autoconfiscated. 

	Added a list of configured features to pdsh -V output.

	Avoid non-portable gethostbyname_r call on non-AIX system by doing 
	all DNS lookups before threads start up.

	Configure --with-ssh configures pdsh to use ssh for all connections.
	Configure --with-krb4 configures pdsh to use krb4 for all connnections.
	The two configuration options cannot be specified together.  In the
	absense of either, rsh is used (the preferred option).  Got rid of 
	-e, -R, and -k options for selecting these at runtime.  Do not use
	rsh for non-root users if --with-krb4 specified.

	Support ssh2's different option for batch mode.

	If --with-machines=/path/to/machines is specified, use that for -a
	processing no matter what.  In the absense of a machines file, if
	SDRGetObjects exists, use that; if nodeattr exists, use that.
	None of the above is a configure error.

	Released version 1.6 to web site: http://www.llnl.gov/icc/lc/pdsh.html
	Released version 1.6-chaos1 internally.

Release 1.6+
	
	Misc cleanup of headers, function defs, README, and man pages.
	Run man pages through autoconf.

	Test HAVE_WORKING_STRERROR_R before using strerror_r (pdsh-1.6 %m 
	fails on AIX).

	Added HAVE_MTSAFE_GETHOSTBYNAME and HAVE_MAGIC_RSHELL_CLEANUP in
	place of #ifdef _AIX.

	Use socklen_t for accept() length argument and add a check in
	autoconf to default it to int if undefined.

	Rcp code now handles short writes on socket.  A short write would
	have corrupted the copied file, though this has never been reported.

	Additional configure options: --with-fanout=N, --with-timeout=N, 
	--with-rangeop=c.  Removed -x and -X options since this is now
	configurable at compile time.

	Print "timed out" message instead of "interrupted system call" if
	xrcmd/qcmd times out waiting for a response from the server (gnats:45).

Thu Apr 11 05:13:08 PDT 2002
	RMS: Get rid of -P and -N options and use RMS_RESOURCEID as set by
	the RMS 'allocate' command instead.

	Change semantics of -n option: now it is tasks per node instead of 
	total number of tasks.  This is no longer a qshell specific argument,
	but unless qshell is used it must be == 1.
