.SH NAME
pdcp \- copy files to groups of hosts in parallel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdcp
.I "[-options] src [src2...] dest"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pdsh
is a variant of the rcp(1) command.  Unlike rcp(1) which copies files to
a single remote host, pdcp(1) can copy files to multiple remote hosts in 
parallel.  Options are described in TARGET NODE LIST OPTIONS and OTHER OPTIONS 
below.
.LP
When pdcp receives SIGINT (ctrl-C), it lists the status of current threads.
A second SIGINT within one second terminates the program.

.SH TARGET NODE LIST OPTIONS
.I "-w host,host,..."
Target the specified hosts.  No spaces are allowed in the comma-separated
list.  A list consisting of a single "-" character causes the target hosts
to be read from stdin, one per line.  The host list may contain comma-separated
hostname ranges of the form ``host1-5'' or ``host[1-5]''.
.LP
.I "-x"
In combiation with -w, do not attempt to expand hostname ranges.  Setting the 
PDSH_RANGE_OPERATOR environment variable to the empty string has the 
same effect.
.LP 
.I "-X c"
In combination with -w, use character 'c' as a range operator when expanding 
hostname ranges.  Alternatively, the PDSH_RANGE_OPERATOR enviornment variable 
can be used to set this value.
.LP
.I "-a"
Target "all" nodes in the cluster.
.if @HAVE_MACHINES@ The list of hostnames is taken from the MPICH machines file.
.el \{
.if @HAVE_SDR@ \{
.I "-v"
In combination with -a, eliminate nodes that the SDR thinks are down.
.LP
.I "-G"
In combination with -a, include all partitions. 
.LP
.I "-i"
In combination with -a, use SDR initial_hostname instead of reliable_hostname.
\}
\}
.if @HAVE_GENDERS@ \{
.I "-g attribute"
Target nodes that have the specified genders attribute.	
.if !@HAVE_SDR@ \{
.I "-i"
In combination with -a or -g, use a hostname specified as the value of the
``altname'' genders attribute instead of the normal one.
\}
\}
.LP
If none of the above options are specified, the WCOLL environment variable
must point to a file that contains a list of nodes, one per line.  
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.I "-r"
Copy recursively.
.LP
.I "-p"
Preserve modification time and modes.
.LP
.I "-q"
List option values and the target host list and exit without action.
.LP
.I "-f number"
Set the maximum number of simultaneous remote copies.  The default is 
@FANOUT@.
.LP
.I "-l user"
This option may be used to copy files as another user, subject to
authorization.  For BSD rcmd, this means the invoking user and system must
be listed in the user\'s .rhosts file (even for root).
.LP
.I "-t seconds"
Set the connect timeout.  Default is @CONNECT_TIMEOUT@ seconds.  
(This is in concurrent with the normal socket-level timeout).
.LP
.I "-d"
Include more complete thread status when SIGINT is received, and display
connect and command time statistics on stderr when done.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.if @HAVE_SSH@ \{
This copy of pdsh has been configured to use
.B ssh
which causes the stderr of ssh to be folded in with that of the remote 
command.  When invoked by pdsh, it is not possible for ssh to prompt for 
confirmation if a host key changes, prompt for passwords if RSA keys are not 
configured properly, etc..  Finally, the connect timeout is not adjustable 
when ssh is used.
\}

.SH "ORIGIN"
Pdsh/pdcp was originally a rewrite of IBM dsh(1) by Jim Garlick
.br
<garlick@llnl.gov>
on LLNL's ASCI Blue-Pacific IBM SP system.  
It is now also used on Linux clusters at LLNL.
