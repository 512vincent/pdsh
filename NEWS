This file describes changes in recent versions of pdsh. It primarily
documents thos changes that are of interest to users and admins.

* Changes in pdsh-2.1  (2004-06-09)
===================================
 -- Fix dshbak script to allow whitespace in hostname "tags"
    (Ashley Pittman <ashley@quadrics.com>).
 -- Fix broken QsNet support on Elan3 systems without libelanctrl.
 -- Explicitly set thread stack size to 128K to avoid arbitrarily
    large stack set from current rlimit under Linux/NPTL.

* Changes in pdsh-2.0  (2004-05-26)
===================================
 -- Reorganized pdsh source tree.
 -- Modularized pdsh functionality into dynamic runtime "modules."
   - Moved remote command api (e.g. rsh, ssh, etc.) into "rcmd" modules.
   - New pdsh option `-R' for selection of rcmd type at runtime.
   - All other optional functionality moved into "misc" modules (e.g. genders).
   - See README.modules in pdsh distribution for more information.
 -- Package core pdsh functionality and pdsh modules separately in order to
    make pdsh installation much more flexible.
 -- Removed pdsh dependency on rcp. Rcp server code used by pdsh is now
    coded directly into pdcp. (Note: This means pdcp *must* be installed
    on all target nodes)
 -- Added mrsh and mqshell client modules, as well as mqshd server for Munge
    authenticated rcmd() support.
 -- Added SLURM module to build list of targets from SLURM allocations.
 -- (genders) Added "-X" option to exclude targets based on genders attributes.
 -- (genders) Multiple attributes may now be passed to "-g" and "-X."
 -- (genders) "-a" renamed to "-A" -- "-a" now skips any nodes in genders
    database with "pdsh_all_skip" attribute.
 -- (genders) New "-F" option to specify non-default genders file.
 -- QsNet support now requires "/etc/elanhosts" config file (see README.QsNet).
 -- QsNet support includes support for QSW elanctrl interface. (Elan3/Elan4)
 -- Added support for running Elan network error resolver thread in qshd/mqshd.
    (Elan3 only)
 -- Nominal support for Elan multirail jobs (largely untested). See
    qshell and mqshell `-r railmask' option.
