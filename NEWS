* Changes in pdsh 2.0  
======================
 -- Modularized pdsh functionality into dynamic runtime "modules."
   - Moved remote command api (e.g. rsh, ssh, etc.) into "rcmd" modules.
   - New pdsh option `-R' for selection of rcmd type at runtime.
   - All other optional functionality moved into "misc" modules (e.g. genders).
   - See README.modules in pdsh distribution for more information.
 -- Package core pdsh functionality and pdsh modules separately in order to
    make pdsh installation much more flexible.
 -- Removed pdsh dependency on rcp. Rcp server code used by pdsh is now
    coded directly into pdcp.
 -- Added mrsh and mqshell client modules, as well as mqshd server for Munge
    authenticated rcmd() support.
 -- QsNet support now requires "/etc/elanhosts" config file (see README.QsNet).
 -- Added support for running Elan network error resolver thread in qshd/mqshd.
