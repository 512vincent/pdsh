Compiling pdsh under AIX:

Pdsh has been compiled successfully under AIX 5.1 with both dynamic
as well as static modules (--enable-static-modules). To get dynamically
loadable module support, you must run configure with:

 LDFLAGS="-Wl,-bexpall -Wl,-brtl" ./configure [configure args]

To use the AIX native complier, use the configure semantics:

 CC=xlc LDFLAGS="-Wl,-bexpall -Wl,-brtl" ./configure ...
